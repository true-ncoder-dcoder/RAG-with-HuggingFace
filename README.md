# RAG Implementation with LangChain and HuggingFace

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain and HuggingFace's Transformers library. This project utilizes the databricks/databricks-dolly-15k dataset and Intel/dynamic_tinybert large language model (LLM) for enhanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities.
